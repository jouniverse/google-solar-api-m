Layer,Pixel depth,Resolution,Description
Digital Surface Model (DSM),32-bit float,0.1 m/pixel, "Elevation data that represents the topography of Earth's surface, including natural and built features. Values are in meters above sea level. Invalid locations, or areas where we don't have data, are stored as -9999."
RGB,8-bit,0.1 m/pixel 0.25 m/pixel 0.5 m/pixel 1 m/pixel, "An aerial image of the region. The GeoTIFF imagery file contains three bands corresponding to red, green and blue values in order to form 24-bit RGB value for each pixel. By default, the pixel resolution is 0.1 m/pixel."
Building mask,1-bit,0.1 m/pixel,"One bit per pixel indicating whether that pixel is considered to be part of a rooftop."
Annual flux,32-bit float,0.1 m/pixel,"The annual flux map, or annual sunlight on roofs, of the region. Values are kWh/kW/year. Flux is computed for every location, not just building rooftops. Invalid locations, or areas where we couldn't calculate flux, are stored as -9999. Locations outside our coverage area are invalid. Note: This is unmasked flux."
Monthly flux,32-bit float,0.5 m/pixel,"The monthly flux map (sunlight on roofs, broken down by month) of the region. Values are kWh/kW/year. The GeoTIFF imagery file contains 12 bands corresponding to January — December, in order."
Hourly shade,32-bit integer,1 m/pixel,"12 URLs for hourly shade maps corresponding to January — December, in order. Each GeoTIFF file contains 24 bands, corresponding to the 24 hours of the day. Each pixel is a 32 bit integer, corresponding to the (up to) 31 days of that month. A 1 bit means that the corresponding location is able to see the sun on that day, at that hour, in that month. Invalid locations are stored as -9999 and have bit 31 set, as that corresponds to the 32nd day of the month and is therefore invalid."
